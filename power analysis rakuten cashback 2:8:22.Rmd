This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

n <- seq(80000000,40000000,-10000000)

pwr.t2n.test(n1 = n, n2= 85000000 - n, d = .004, alternative="greater")

pwr.t2n.test(n1 = n, n2= 85000000 - n, d = .003, alternative="greater")

pwr.t2n.test(n1 = n, n2= 85000000 - n, d = .002, alternative="greater")

#assuming 20% match rate

pwr.t2n.test(n1 = n, n2= 85000000 - n, d = .0008, alternative="greater")

pwr.t2n.test(n1 = n, n2= 85000000 - n, d = .0006, alternative="greater")

pwr.t2n.test(n1 = n, n2= 85000000 - n, d = .0004, alternative="greater")


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
